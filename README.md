# clipbored.vim

Clipboard mappings the way I like them.

## Installation

### pathogen

Install [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) and run

```sh
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone git://github.com/poxar/vim-clipbored.git
```

### vim-plug

Install and setup [plug.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) and put

```vim
Plug 'poxar/vim-clipbored'
```

in your `vimrc`

## Usage

Everything you copy/cut/put/change goes in or comes from the clipboard, no
matter what operating system you're on.

On Linux you can access the primary selection by prepending `<leader>` to the
commands `dDyYpPcC`.
